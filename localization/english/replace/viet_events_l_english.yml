 VIETmisc.0001.desc:0 "On the road near my residence, I came across a traveling bard who offered to sing me a song called "Scarborough Fair." I decided there was nothing to lose, and allowed this bard to sing the song. The opening lines of the song are:\n\n"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.\nRemember me to one who lives there.\nShe once was a true love of mine."\n\nIt turned out to be a truly profound and beautiful song, and brought a tear to my eye and that of my guards."
 VIETmisc.0001.a:0 "Bravo, bravo! To Scarborough Fair we go!"
 VIETmisc.0002.t:0 "The Heartland"
 VIETmisc.0002.desc:0 "In my dreams, I travel to a seemingly gorgeous, pastoral land. It is filled with meadows of the greenest grass, peaceful quiet forests and streams, and cozy cities and villages scattered all over. I end up in one of these little settlements, and spend some time there enjoying myself, getting to know the inhabitants. Where am I at, specifically?"
 VIETmisc.0002.a:0 "A small forest town located near a picturesque stream."

 VIETmisc.0003.desc:0 "On a visit to a nearby town, I met with a few prominent merchants. One of these merchants, a well-traveled gastronome who enjoys discovering the foods of different lands, gave me some baklava as a gift. It is a pastry from the eastern Mediterranean that is made from thin layers of dough, filled with syrup, honey, and nuts. Truly, it is one of the most delicious foods ever imagined."
 VIETmisc.0003.a:0 "Thank you! Your gift is much appreciated."
 VIETmisc.0004.t:0 "Idle Conversation"
 VIETmisc.0004.desc:0 "I am overhearing a conversation between two of my guards.\n\n"Heard any news from the other regions?"\n\n"Nothing I'd like to talk about."\n\n"I've heard others say the same."\n\n"I ran into some..."\n\nI am getting rather bored, and wonder whether I should keep listening to their chatter, which I find inane and devoid of substance."
 VIETmisc.0004.a:0 "I'll find something else to distract myself with."
 VIETmisc.0004.b:0 "I have nothing better to do, so I don't mind hearing them chat."
 VIETmisc.0005.t:0 "A Forgotten Dream?"
 VIETmisc.0005.desc:0 "I had an amazing dream last night! After I woke up, I immediately found the nearest person, one of my servants, and began to recount what happened in the dream.\n\nExcept... by that point I had forgotten what had happened in my dream. I stumbled over my words as I struggled to recall any details of my dream as my servant stood there awkwardly.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what happens in the world of dreams?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a:0 "How irritating. Oh well!"
 VIETmisc.0005.b:0 "I must remember! Why can't I? Why?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a.a:0 "You remember what the dream was about"
 VIETmisc.0005.toast.a:0 "You remembered what the dream was about"

 VIETmisc.0007.desc:0 "One of my servants recently just experienced a personal tragedy, as their beloved child died from illness. This servant is, of course, now in mourning, a look of uttermost grief on their often tear-stained face. All the other servants and even a few members of my court are doing their best to comfort this servant of mine, so perhaps I should offer at least a few kind words as well."
 VIETmisc.0007.a:0 ""I am sincerely sorry for your loss and pain that you are going through.""
 VIETmisc.0007.b:0 ""Your child is now in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm] with [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].""
 VIETmisc.0007.c:0 "Why do I need to say anything? Peasants die all the time."

 VIETmisc.0008.t:0 "Fresh Air"
 VIETmisc.0008.desc:0 "I take a quick walk outside, and the feel of the shining sun on my face is just amazing and comforting."

 VIETmisc.0009.t:0 "Ah!"
 VIETmisc.0009.desc:0 "While sitting outside, I was feeling rather thirsty and asked a servant to fetch me some water. After drinking it, I felt truly refreshed! It is amazing the effect some cool, fresh water can have on a person."

 VIETmisc.0010.t:0 "Numb Legs"
 VIETmisc.0010.desc:0 "While attending to chamber business, I sat on the chamber pot for too long that my legs got too numb. I'm afraid if I stand up, I might slip."

 VIETmisc.0010.b:0 "I'll be fine - ouch!"
 VIETmisc.0010.b.a:0 "You manage to stand up without any trouble"

 VIETmisc.0012.t:0 "Hauntings"
 VIETmisc.0012.desc:0 "There are rumors that a ghost has been haunting a part of residence for the past few days. Some servants reported seeing a strange shadow appear and disappear. However, others are convinced these are just hallucinations."
 VIETmisc.0012.a:0 "There! I just saw it! It... no, that can't have just been a shadow!"
 VIETmisc.0012.b:0 "Silly superstitions! They are just seeing things."
 VIETmisc.0012.c:0 "Can we ask a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] to say some prayers?"
 VIETmisc.0012.d:0 "I don't fear the ghosts! Let them come!"
 VIETmisc.0012.e:0 "I am sure it's nothing... right?"
 VIETmisc.0013.t:0 "A Mis-Step"
 VIETmisc.0013.desc:0 "I was walking outside in the garden with the rest of my court when my foot slipped and I nearly tumbled. Thankfully I caught my step before it was too late, but it was still embarrassing it happened in front of the whole court, as I must have looked like a fool!"
 VIETmisc.0013.a:0 "Not that big a deal, honestly."
 VIETmisc.0013.b:0 "Try to pretend it didn't happen."
 VIETmisc.0013.c:0 "Make a self-deprecating joke."
 VIETmisc.0014.t:0 "An Embarrassing Memory"
 VIETmisc.0014.desc:0 "I suddenly remembered an embarrassing memory from the past. When I think of what I did, my heart tightens and I can't help but shudder at my foolish actions or thoughts. Why did I even do that back then, and more importantly, why does my brain remind me about these things?"
 VIETmisc.0014.a:0 "Why is it invading my thoughts? Agh!"
 VIETmisc.0015.t:0 "A Happy Memory"
 VIETmisc.0015.desc:0 "I suddenly recalled a happy memory from my past. Though it happened long ago, it still brings a smile to my face."
 VIETmisc.0015.a:0 "What good times those were."
 VIETmisc.0016.t:0 "Increased Workload"
 VIETmisc.0016.desc:0 "Things have been pretty busy lately. I've been doing a lot of work, reviewing documents and signing them, thinking about what to do for my realm, and so on. It's all I ever think about. A few people have told me perhaps it is best I relax and take it easy."
 VIETmisc.0016.a:0 "I should reduce my workload."
 VIETmisc.0016.b:0 "I must continue doing my work."
 VIETmisc.0016.c:0 "What's wrong with me? I hate work! No more work!"
 VIETmisc.0017.t:0 "An Early Bird"
 VIETmisc.0017.desc:0 "By chance I woke up earlier than I usually do today and can't go back to sleep. I have some important documents to review that I could get a head start on, but on the other hand, why should I have to worry about that?"
 VIETmisc.0017.a:0 "I will relax and enjoy the morning before my official duties begin."
 VIETmisc.0017.b:0 "No, I need to be responsible and start working."
 VIETmisc.0018.t:0 "Too Late!"
 VIETmisc.0018.desc:0 "A few days ago, I was having a conversation with someone. It wasn't an intense quarrel by any means, but the discussion was a little heated at some points. The other person made a good argument that I didn't have any comeback to, even though I knew they were wrong.\n\nJust today, while I was going about my business, I finally thought of a proper counterargument I could have used in that conversation. My mind sure works in mysterious ways - why didn't I think of it sooner? If I had thought of it, I would have surely won our little debate... right? "
 VIETmisc.0018.a:0 "This is so frustrating!"
 VIETmisc.0019.t:0 "An Old Shrine"
 VIETmisc.0019.desc:0 "I paid a visit to some small ruins not too far away. Locals say many generations ago it served as a tiny [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] in the area, a place for those who truly believed in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] to worship, though others are skeptical. Regardless, I prayed there for a while."
 VIETmisc.0019.a:0 "It was a good experience."
 VIETmisc.0019.b:0 "I only did it out of courtesy and obligation."
 VIETmisc.0020.t:0 "Ha Ha!"
 VIETmisc.0020.desc:0 "I heard a great joke earlier today that made me laugh without stopping for a couple minutes, but now I can't recall it at all. This is really bothering me."
 VIETmisc.0020.a:0 "Oh well, at least I had a good laugh!"
 VIETmisc.0021.t:0 "Who's there?"
 VIETmisc.0021.desc:0 ""[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!" a voice calls from behind. "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"\n\n"Who is it?" I say loudly.\n\nSilence.\n\nHmm. Odd.\n\nI thought I heard someone calling my name. Yet, when I turned my head around, there was no one around.\n\nVery odd...."
 VIETmisc.0021.a:0 "Must have been my imagination."
 VIETmisc.0022.t:0 "A Boring Meeting"
 VIETmisc.0022.desc:0 "It was an ordinary, mundane meeting with my council. We were discussing a rather boring topic that wasn't of the utmost urgency. I looked around, seeing my councilors as they droned on and on about this or that, and wondered whether any of this was worth my attention."
 VIETmisc.0022.a:0 "Look outside the window and see what's out there."
 VIETmisc.0022.b:0 "Pretend to look like I am paying attention."
 VIETmisc.0022.c:0 "Try to focus on the discussion even if it's boring."
 VIETmisc.0023.t:0 "Got to Go, Got to Go Right Now!"
 VIETmisc.0023.desc:0 "A very important envoy from a foreign state is paying me a visit. I sit on my throne, listening to this talkative gentleman drone on, and on, and on, and on. It seems to go on forever, and I am even starting to doze off out of boredom, when I realize something alarming. Dangerous, even.\n\nI really need to go to the chamber pot.\n\nBadly.\n\nRight now.\n\nI can't hold it in, I am about to burst any moment now - what do I do?"
 VIETmisc.0023.a:0 "I must run to the chamber pot immediately!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b:0 "I must... hold it in... NO!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b.a:0 "You manage to hold in your bladder"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success.title:0 "Your successfully held your bladder in!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success:0 "After the envoy leaves, you immediately sprint to the chamber pot."
 VIETmisc.0023.b.b:0 "You fail to hold in your bladder"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure.title:0 "You couldn't hold your bladder in!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure:0 "You have an accident in front of the envoy. Embarrassing, yet preventable - why didn't you listen to your body's natural instincts to run to the chamber pot?"
 VIETmisc.0024.t:0 "Unfortunate Flower"
 VIETmisc.0024.desc:0 "While taking a walk outside I found a very beautiful flower. However, as I went over to take a closer look at it, potentially to pick it up and keep it, I misstepped and accidentally stomped on it."
 VIETmisc.0024.a:0 "Oh well, it can't be helped!"
 VIETmisc.0024.b:0 "No! I wanted that flower! Dammit!"
 VIETmisc.0025.t:0 "Cool Breeze"
 VIETmisc.0025.desc:0 "I'm standing outside when I feel the gentle breeze against my face. It feels so refreshing, so relaxing."
 VIETmisc.0025.a:0 "Moments like these make life worth living."
 VIETmisc.0026.t:0 "Missing Document"
 VIETmisc.0026.desc:0 "I came to my desk this morning to wrap up some important paperwork. I searched for the last document I needed to finish, yet I couldn't find it! In a panic, I searched the whole room for what must have been a couple hours. Finally, I found it when I realized I put it in one of my books as a bookmark. My little crisis is averted, but that definitely made me tense and anxious for a while."
 VIETmisc.0026.a.a:0 "You successfully relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.toast.a:0 "You successfully relaxed"
 VIETmisc.0026.a.b:0 "You fail to relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.toast.b:0 "You failed to relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.a:0 "I need to take a deep breath and relax."
 VIETmisc.0027.t:0 "Executing the Psychopath"
 VIETmisc.0027.desc:0 "A murderer was recently caught. His crimes were quite heinous, not to mention he showed no remorse, and said he felt delight at inflicting pain on others. There was little debate on what needed to be done. He was duly sentenced to die a horrible slow execution, and today my court and I got to witness this gory spectacle. Everyone is talking about how such a monster could even exist! What are my thoughts on the matter?"
 VIETmisc.0027.a:0 "Yes, I agree It is tragic that such people exist in this world!"
 VIETmisc.0027.b:0 "I don't care, to be honest, but I have to keep appearances."
 VIETmisc.0027.c:0 "Pity, my army could use another bloodthirsty psychopath."
 VIETmisc.0028.t:0 "Age of Empires"
 VIETmisc.0028.desc:0 "In antiquity, the Romans were one of the greatest empires the world had ever seen. Still, there were other powerful states as well from that ancient time. I am reading stories about the deeds and exploits of other great empires from then, and one in particular inspires me."
 VIETmisc.0028.a:0 "Ashoka of the Mauryans ushered in an era of peace for all India."

 VIETmisc.0029.desc:0 "I was out and about when I noticed something shiny on the ground.\n\nCurious, I went closer to investigate. To my surprise, it turned out to be one very shiny gold coin. Did someone drop it here by accident? Who knows.\n\nThere doesn't look to be anyone around, so it looks like this coin belongs to me now."
 VIETmisc.0029.a:0 "It is very shiny indeed." 
 VIETmisc.0030.t:0 "Careful, Now"
 VIETmisc.0030.desc:0 ""It's been an honor to meet. Thank you for your hospitality, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].... Until we meet again." The foreign envoy bows to me in respect, and is about to leave.\n\nI stand up to say farewell, but stumble out of my chair and clumsily fall on the ground.\n\nThankfully I did not hurt myself, but that was still embarrassing!"
 VIETmisc.0030.a:0 "At least the envoy was polite about it."
 VIETmisc.0031.t:0 "Good Dream"
 VIETmisc.0031.desc:0 "I had a dream where I came into a realm of light, and nothing but light. Light was everywhere, and all I could see. Yet this did not frighten me - if anything, I felt at peace with the cosmos.\n\nAfter I woke up, the feeling of serenity stayed with me for the rest of the day."
 VIETmisc.0031.a:0 "Surely this is a sign from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 VIETmisc.0031.b:0 "I feel invigorated and at ease."
 VIETmisc.0032.t:0 "Bad Dream"
 VIETmisc.0032.desc:0 "I had a dream where I was in a realm of darkness, and nothing but darkness. I could not see anything, and though there was nothing explicitly threatening me, I could not help but feel a great sense of dread.\n\nAfter I woke up, these feelings of dread continued for the rest of the day."
 VIETmisc.0032.a:0 "Is [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] warning me? Or showing disapproval?"
 VIETmisc.0032.b:0 "I feel uneasy about everything now."
 VIETmisc.0033.t:0 "Challenging Reading"
 VIETmisc.0033.desc:0 "The book I'm reading is very difficult, and its deeper meanings continue to elude me. Learned men say even the wisest among them still have trouble at times reading this book. And yet, it is said to contain great wisdoms to learn from if you can understand it. Should I persevere to try to continue reading through this, or should I give up?"
 VIETmisc.0033.a:0 "This book is not worth my energy."
 VIETmisc.0033.b:0 "I must try no matter what!"

 VIETmisc.0035.desc:0 "I am at a meeting with several notables of my realm, discussing important business pertaining to managing my domain, when I start to feel it. My head... itchy!\n\nI scratch my head slightly but discretely, thinking that would've taken care of it, but I was mistaken! My head is even itchier now, and I want to scratch it so badly even if I'll look like a crazed monkey in front of these people. Aagh!"
 VIETmisc.0035.a:0 "I don't care! My head is too itchy! I'll scratch it to hell!"

 VIETmisc.0036.t:0 "Eating Too Fast"
 VIETmisc.0036.desc:0 "At dinner today, I was too eager to eat and burnt my tongue when I tried to get started on the soup. Everyone in the room looked at me, either in alarm or shaking their heads at my folly."

 VIETmisc.0036.b:0 "Happens to the best of us! We laughed it off."
 VIETmisc.0037.t:0 "A Nosy Problem"
 VIETmisc.0037.desc:0 "While relaxing in my courtyard, I notice one of my young maidservants trying to discreetly pick her nose. To be fair to her, she is very discrete about it, and no one else noticed. On the other hand, it is a rather rude thing to do, and as she's still somewhat young, perhaps she needs to learn proper manners."
 VIETmisc.0037.a:0 "I'm sure she didn't mean to, something must have clogged up her nose."
 VIETmisc.0037.b:0 "I'll approach her in secret later to gently reprimand her about this."
 VIETmisc.0037.c:0 "Ha! I'll mock her in front of everyone to teach her a lesson."
 VIETmisc.0037.d:0 "How dare she! Give her some lashings. That ought to do it."
 VIETmisc.0038.t:0 "The Purpose of Storytelling"
 VIETmisc.0038.desc:0 "I overhear two of my servants arguing about a play they recently attended. I happen to have seen this play too, and listen carefully to hear their discussion.\n\n"You actually like it? The story's terrible and silly!" the portly maid says. "It only appeals to those without taste."\n\n"You are wrong there," the tall, thin manservant counters. "It"s precisely meant to be mindless entertainment. Sometimes, we need stories that are light-hearted - who wants to deal with serious, sad tales all the time?"\n\nPerhaps I should intervene in their debate?"
 VIETmisc.0038.a:0 "No, I've no interest in this topic."
 VIETmisc.0038.b:0 "I agree with the maid - that play was complete garbage."
 VIETmisc.0038.c:0 "The manservant is right. It wasn't quality, but it made me laugh."
 VIETmisc.0038.d:0 "Both of you bring up good points, to be honest."

 VIETmisc.0039.desc:0 "I am attending the wedding of two local nobles. The groom and bride are close, as they had known each other since they were children, and they get along with each other splendidly, much to the relief of the parents. Everyone believes this marriage will be a very successful one."
 VIETmisc.0039.a:0 "I think so too. The couple look blissfully happy."
 VIETmisc.0039.b:0 "Come on. Every marriage eventually devolves into arguments and cheating."
 VIETmisc.0039.c:0 "I don't care about it as much as all the delicious food here!"
 VIETmisc.0039.d:0 "Too many people here - I think I"ll just go sit in the corner."
 VIETmisc.0039.e:0 "It's nice and all, but I spot a rather attractive servant over there."
 VIETmisc.0040.t:0 "It Will Be Alright... Right?"
 VIETmisc.0040.desc:0 ""It's going to be alright, things will always get better," my nanny used to tell me when I was a child and feeling scared or frustrated.\n\nI've been thinking about those words a lot lately, especially when I'm dealing with a lot of things on my mind. But now, my nanny is no longer here to comfort me.\n\nI have to wonder whether things will be alright in the end."
 VIETmisc.0040.a:0 "Of course it will be! It has to be...."
 VIETmisc.0040.b:0 "Life is different when you're no longer a child, alas."
 VIETmisc.0041.t:0 "Bump!"
 VIETmisc.0041.desc:0 "While we were taking a walk in the garden outside, [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetTitledFirstName] slipped and bumped into me! No one was hurt, nor did anyone fall down, but it was a rather embarrassing affair and [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetSheHe] looks quite sheepish for [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetHerHis] accidental disrespect towards me."
 VIETmisc.0041.a:0 "It's fine! I should have been careful too."
 VIETmisc.0041.b:0 "How dare you, you knave!"
 VIETmisc.0042.t:0 "A Problem"
 VIETmisc.0042.desc:0 "Today, I am meeting with a visitor from one of the powerful local clans who have great influence over a small but important part of my realm. I met this person the other day, when we got to know each other formally. This meeting will clearly be crucial, as I hope to discuss a number of things concerning the realm's business with my esteemed guest.\n\nI now see my guest, and hurry over. As I am about to say my greetings, however, something unimaginably terrible happens!"
 VIETmisc.0042.a:0 "Oh no! What do I do now?"

 VIETmisc.0043.desc:0 "Tragedy! I have forgotten my guest's name!\n\nWhat was their name? Was it this? Or was it that? No, it couldn't have been... or maybe it was....\n\nI force a smile to buy myself time as my brain scrambles to remember their name.\n\nWhat do I do? I only have a few more moments to say something before this gets too awkward."
 VIETmisc.0043.a:0 "I'll just have to guess their name!"
 VIETmisc.0043.b:0 "I'll skillfully speak in a way that avoids their name, awkward as it may be."

 VIETmisc.0044.desc.1:0 "Lately, rumors are circulating about how I had an amorous encounter with one of the peasants in a nearby village that resulted in a child. This is, of course, completely foolish."
 VIETmisc.0044.desc.lustful:0 "Now I love to have a good tumble with a good looking peasant as much as any lusty [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan], but that doesn't mean I've found anyone in that village to my liking."

 VIETmisc.0048.desc:0 "I am watching a play being performed by a troupe of traveling actors. The quality of their acting is… bad, and that's an understatement. The main problem is that they are overly melodramatic when they act, so none of their characters or storylines seem believable.\n\nWhen the play is finished, the response from the audience is anemic at best. It seems most people don’t like their acting either, and I'm surprised no one was booing them off stage - the acting troupe is definitely lucky in that regard! How do they even survive?"

 VIETmisc.0052.desc:0 "While visiting a local nobleman, he shows us one of his prized possessions: a painting he acquired sometime ago that depicts a beautiful woman. Now, paintings about people are nothing out of the ordinary, but this painting in particular is famous because the artist managed to do an extremely realistic depiction of a person - so real, that it almost feels as if that the painting looks as if it is a real, living, breathing lady, who at any moment will jump out the frame and interact with us."

It is only after they consummate their love, marry, and have children that they tragically learn the truth. Their community ostracizes them, and unable to come to terms with their actions they commit suicide at the end of the story.\n\nTruly a sad tale, full of twists and turns! Everyone agrees it was a riveting performance."

During this time, she dreamt of visiting hell, and saw many terrifying visions.\n\nAfter she recovered, she realized she was given a second chance, and reformed to live a good, virtuous life, so she claims (the other elderly villagers say that part is true)."

He thanks her profusely, before he disappears into the crowd.\n\nAs I return to my shopping, I overhear one of my guards saying, “What a foolish woman! I would’ve just taken those coins.”\n\n“Is that what you’d really do?” another guard says. “That’d be an affront to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].”\n\n“Perhaps you two should focus on your present duties,” a third guard warns them, “and not engage in idle chatter.”"

 VIETmisc.0147.t:0 "The Almshouse"
 VIETmisc.0147.desc:0 "A number of notables in the area have banded together to contribute funds for the establishment of an almshouse in a local town. They have approached me, asking if I would like to contribute some funds of my own. They argue this will help provide some relief for destitute and poor commoners, who have nowhere else to turn to for help. I have no reason to doubt these notables, as they are all men and women of good standing in the community, so it is up to me to decide on if I feel my money is well-spent on this matter."
 VIETmisc.0147.a:0 "They can have some funds for their project."
 VIETmisc.0147.b:0 "I will donate a lot for this noble cause!"
 VIETmisc.0147.c:0 "I don’t want to waste money on these lowlifes."
 VIETmisc.0147.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Charity has a long history. Medieval almshouses were usually established by wealthy and prominent patrons (whether out of genuine concern, or for ulterior motives), and often associated with local religious institutions, regardless of whether they were Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, and so on. Almshouses would typically provide shelter and food to the poor, old, and ill."

 VIETmisc.0148.t:0 "A Single Leaf"
 VIETmisc.0148.desc:0 "We were traveling to another village when we decided to take a quick break along the side of the road. I rested against a tree, and dozed off for a while. I only woke up when I felt a leaf from the tree land on my face. I picked up the leaf and twirled it in my fingers; looking up, I mused out loud, perhaps a little absentmindedly, “Did the leaf truly come from that tree?”"
 VIETmisc.0148.a:0 "That was a good nap."
 VIETmisc.0149.t:0 "Wait - Do You Hear That?"
 VIETmisc.0149.desc:0 "I was taking a walk in the wilderness near my house with a few of my guards. We grew alarmed when we heard the noise of leaves crunching nearby. Could it be some sort of assassin or bandit?\n\nThankfully, our fears were for naught - it turned out the source of the noise was a couple mice moving about on top of some leaves. After noticing us, they scurried back under some bushes."
 VIETmisc.0149.a:0 "What a relief!"
 VIETmisc.0150.t:0 "Golden Leaf"
 VIETmisc.0150.desc:0 "A local notable presented me with a gift today. It is a leaf made out of pure gold, carefully crafted in an attractive, mesmerizing manner. Though a small gift, it is something anyone can appreciate - myself included."
 VIETmisc.0150.a:0 "I know where this would look good in my house!"
 VIETmisc.0151.t:0 "What's That?"
 VIETmisc.0151.desc:0 "I thought I saw something in a bush nearby. I ordered a couple of my guards to approach it. With weapons drawn, they moved cautiously towards the bush, which looked like it was even starting to wiggle around! However, once they got close enough, a couple birds flew out of the bush - perhaps they were stuck to it, or were engaging in some kind of business."
 VIETmisc.0151.a:0 "For a moment I thought it was… never mind."
 VIETmisc.0152.t:0 "Sprucing Things Up"
 VIETmisc.0152.desc:0 "My gardener informed me today that he thinks there is a section of my residence that could use some aesthetic improvements. When asked what he meant, he explained that a particular part of my courtyard could use a large number of carefully chosen bushes, which he can trim into various attractive shapes. It would make the current area, which looks relatively empty, a little more visually stimulating and appealing."
 VIETmisc.0152.a:0 "Splendid idea! I look forward to seeing what you do."
 VIETmisc.0152.b:0 "I see what you mean, but I don’t think we need it."
 VIETmisc.0153.t:0 "An Inconvenient Bush"
 VIETmisc.0153.desc:0 "I tripped and fell into a bush while taking a walk. If that weren’t bad enough, my clothes got tangled in the bush. After my guards successfully pulled me out of the bush, I had a number of scratches all over myself, and parts of my clothes had small holes in them."
 VIETmisc.0153.a:0 "Am I having another bad day again?"
 VIETmisc.0154.t:0 "Berry Good"
 VIETmisc.0154.desc:0 "While out and about in my realm, I spot a commoner huddled over a bush. I approach her, curious, and see that she is examining some berries in the bush.\n\n“Ah, forgive me for not noticing you, my [Root.Char.GetLadyLord]!” she says, before greeting me courteously. She is a friendly-looking, middle-aged woman with greying hair and a toothy grin. “Just as you have your important business to take care of, my important work today is that I’m on the hunt for some berries.”\n\n“Are those poisonous berries?” I ask. “They don’t look like any I recognize.”\n\n“Oh yes, be careful, these should not be eaten. But those over there, they are fine,” she says. “Very good for pastries.”"
 VIETmisc.0154.a:0 "We talk about various berries for a while, before we part ways."

 VIETmisc.0155.t:0 "Centenarian"
 VIETmisc.0155.desc:0 "I have received word that a village elder living nearby has recently attained the distinguished age of 100 years old. Over a century old! That is truly remarkable. It is exceedingly rare for someone to live for such a long time in this day and age. A few of my courtiers suggest that perhaps I should congratulate this elder somehow, if only to present myself favorably to the locals."
 VIETmisc.0155.a:0 "That’s nice, but why bother meeting a peasant?"
 VIETmisc.0155.b:0 "Yes! I must bestow upon this elder some fine gifts."
 VIETmisc.0155.c:0 "I'll visit the elder to congratulate them in person."
 VIETmisc.0156.t:0 "A Pot of Gold"
 VIETmisc.0156.desc:0 "I was outside, observing my gardener while he was at work. He was digging deeply into the ground near an old tree when he struck something hard. At first, we thought it was some sort of rock, but it turned out to be a small, sealed ceramic pot.\n\nCurious, we took it out and managed to break it open. Inside were a number of gold coins - we counted exactly 100 coins.\n\nUpon further investigation, based on the coins, it seems like this pot was buried a long time ago at this location by someone who never bothered to come back to take it. At any rate, my gardener, a jovial and easy-going fellow, says the pot and its coins now rightfully belong to me."
 VIETmisc.0156.a:0 "No, as you found it, it rightfully belongs to you!"
 VIETmisc.0156.b:0 "It is only fair that we split this find, my friend."
 VIETmisc.0156.c:0 "I'll take that from you, thank you very much."
 VIETmisc.0157.t:0 "The 100 Techniques of Love"
 VIETmisc.0157.desc:0 "“She was a wonderful harlot,” [horny.GetTitledFirstName] says with a hearty laugh. “Never paid for a better woman to keep me company at night!”\n\nI am having a small feast with some courtiers, and the lusty man is recalling an encounter at a brothel he went to a while back. “She said she learned 100 different techniques in the art of love, and it was worth every coin I had to not only have her demonstrate every one of those techniques on me, but explain them to me as well. Who knew intimacy could be such a philosophical art?”\n\nSome of my courtiers listen attentively, fascinated (if not a little too excited), others look irritated and offended at his remarks, yet many just try to awkwardly avoid eye contact with him as he explains these supposed 100 techniques."
 VIETmisc.0157.a:0 "I’ll skillfully divert the conversation to safer topics."
 VIETmisc.0157.b:0 "Stop talking about these crude and vulgar things!"
 VIETmisc.0157.c:0 "This is all too fascinating! I should be taking notes."
 VIETmisc.0158.t:0 "100 Brave Youths"
 VIETmisc.0158.desc:0 "While traveling, I notice a sizable stone on the side of the road, one which is clearly carved by human hands. What is it doing here, I wonder? I get off my horse and come over to investigate. I see there is some sort of writing on the stone, but it is all worn out. There does appear to be some carvings of what appears to be people holding weapons, perhaps fighting.\n\nA few moments later, a traveler is passing by. He notes my attempts at deciphering what the stone is about, and tells me, “I live not too far from here - that stone, according to the elders, commemorates one hundred brave youths from here who, generations ago, sacrificed their lives to defeat the evil bandits who were terrorizing these lands. The battle took place right here.”"
 VIETmisc.0158.a:0 "What fascinating history! And what brave lads, too."
 VIETmisc.0159.t:0 "A Cat Lover"
 VIETmisc.0159.desc:0 "A spinster living not too far from here is reputed to have 100 pet cats. For as long as I’ve known about her, she’s never bothered anyone, though she is eccentric from what I’ve heard. Every time I’ve passed through town, though, and come across her, she’s been polite and respectful to me, but definitely mentally unstable and prone to rambling nonsense.\n\nSome of her neighbors are now complaining to me about her 100 cats. They say the creatures make all manner of frightening noises from her house. The town’s elders have no interest in doing anything about it, so her neighbors are bringing the matter before me. A few of them tell me they’re sure she is an evil sorceress, having all those cats around!"
 VIETmisc.0159.a:0 "That woman hasn’t committed any crime. Now begone!"
 VIETmisc.0159.b:0 "Well… if it’s a problem… force her to abandon her cats."
 VIETmisc.0159.c:0 "I don’t trust her. Imprison her and kill her cats just in case!"
 VIETmisc.0160.t:0 "A Miraculous Mother"
 VIETmisc.0160.desc:0 "I've heard that in a kingdom some distance from here, there is a woman who was reported to have given birth to 100 children in total! Not all at once, of course, but rather over the course of her life. How could someone go through all that? If such a woman exists, she must be a remarkable mother… or an incredible liar."
 VIETmisc.0160.a:0 "Amazing things like this happen all the time in this world."
 VIETmisc.0160.b:0 "I'm sure she just adopted a lot of orphans and lied about it."
 VIETmisc.0161.t:0 "Too Many Shoes!"
 VIETmisc.0161.desc:0 "I have realized to my horror that [spouse.GetFirstName] has somehow acquired a collection of one hundred fancy shoes! At first it started off as a few shoes here, a few shoes there, but now, before I knew it, they're everywhere! Where did [spouse.GetSheHe] have the money to accumulate such vanities? There's now a lot of gossip about this matter, and it reflects poorly on me."
 VIETmisc.0161.a:0 "You must sell off some of those shoes. Now."
 VIETmisc.0161.b:0 "It's an odd habit, but it's none of my business."
 VIETmisc.0162.t:0 "One Hundred Spirits"
 VIETmisc.0162.desc:0 "Last night I had a strange dream, and I am not sure what to make of it.\n\nIn the dream, I was in a twisted vision of my home, where the rooms were dark and not lit at all. I saw many figures appear in my house, their pale faces were serenely neutral. They all began to dance - quietly, mysteriously, and, somehow, beautifully in an eerie way.\n\nI counted exactly one hundred people as I wandered this crowd. When I came to the last person, he told me in a pleasant but tired voice (as he slowly danced around me), "Thank you for hosting us. We are a hundred spirits. We will not cause any trouble."\n\nI woke up early in the morning, and, on instinct, I walked over to my window. Outside, on the edge of the horizon, as the sun was rising, I thought I saw some moving lights. Before I could count them, however, they vanished."
 VIETmisc.0162.a:0 "Maybe I’m seeing things, but that dream… what was that?"
 VIETmisc.0163.t:0 "Calipers"
 VIETmisc.0163.desc:0 "My servants found something very peculiar by my residence. A little off from the road nearby, there was a single wooden barrel, laying on its side. Inside were exactly one hundred calipers. Further investigation shows no leads on who owned the barrel and the calipers, and how it all got there in the first place."
 VIETmisc.0163.a:0 "I suppose some of my servants might make use of those calipers?"
 VIETmisc.0163.b:0 "If there's nothing else we could use them for, might as well sell them."
 VIETmisc.0164.t:0 "The Feud is Over"
 VIETmisc.0164.desc:0 "Today, I am attending a formal meeting between two local noble families. They had been feuding for over one hundred years - exactly one hundred years in fact, as precisely a century ago, on this day, the ancestors of these two families got into some sort of fight at a gathering which spiraled out of hand.\n\nI have previously served as a mediator for these two families to negotiate an agreement for peace, and now my efforts are bearing fruit. The feud had dragged on for too long, at any rate, and many people on both sides were hoping for it to end anyways."
 VIETmisc.0164.a:0 "I hope this is the start of a long period of peace between these two clans."

I see one of my thralls, still embraced by slumber, on the earthern floor of my longhouse. I nudge him with my foot and he rises; now standing and attentive.\n\nExcept... I have forgotten what had happened in my dream. I stumble over my words; struggling to recall any detail.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what happens in the world of dreams?"

Hel's grasp was firm, as she quickly pulled the young girl to rest in the depths of Niflheim. Efforts made by other thralls to soothe the grieving father have proven ineffective. Even some of my own courtiers make attempts, but fail to assuage the man. Perhaps I should offer a few kind words as well."
 VIETmisc.0007.c.norse:0 "I need not say anything. Both man and child are but thralls."

I must have lost track of time while squatting in the garðhús, because after wiping my underside with wool, I realized I could no longer feel my legs. The numbness is so great, that I fear if I try and stand on my own, I could fall and injure myself."

 VIETmisc.0020.t.norse:0 "A Great Jól!"
 VIETmisc.0020.desc.norse:0 "I heard a great joke earlier today. One so good that it made me double over with laughter; dropping my skål of rømmegrøt in the process. When the bowl of porridge struck the ground, it sprayed thick cream onto the front of my courtier's trousers. This somehow enhanced the joke's effectiveness, but I now can't remember the joke."

 VIETmisc.0022.t.norse:0 "And Another þing"
 VIETmisc.0022.desc.norse:0 "Another sunset, another assembly upon the burial mounds of my ancestors. The Karls petitioned, then argued, points of little consequence. Topics ranged from the mundane to the petty, as they often do. Even my most trusted councillors engaged in long-winded debates unworthy of my attention.
