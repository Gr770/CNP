 party_baron.2001.negative:0 "Without any encouragement or approval, it seems that [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] has taken the initiative to speak to [vassal.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char )] about me!\n\n[party_baron.GetSheHe|U] apparently praised me endlessly, but that merely makes me #EMP more#! suspicious of [party_baron.GetHerHis] motivations!"
 party_baron.2001.positive:0 "It seems that [party_baron.Custom('CTPShortName')], entirely of [party_baron.GetHerHis] own initiative, has spoken to [vassal.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )] about me.\n\nIt might have been cause for concern, if not for the fact that [vassal.Custom('CTPFirstNameNoTooltip')] now seems far more friendly and supportive!"

 party_baron.2005.desc:0 "I am surprised, but pleased when [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] appears at my court. Even more so when [party_baron.GetSheHe] wants to speak, just the two of us.\n\n"I didn't want this to be said at a feast or a celebration." [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] seems unusually serious, that lighthearted smile missing for once. "I cannot describe how much you mean to me. I have many friends, but none other such as you.

 party_baron.2007.desc:0 "Even in the middle of a war, [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] finds ways to get up to [party_baron.GetHerHis] usual tricks.

 party_baron.3001.desc:0 "People are head over heels for [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')], and I just don't understand why! [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] is not that great. All [party_baron.GetSheHe] does is act friendly and celebrate the good things about the people [party_baron.GetSheHe] meets! Yes, even having disagreements with [party_baron.GetHerHim] can be pleasant and friendly, and [party_baron.GetSheHe] stands for [party_baron.GetHerHis] convictions while trying to understand yours, but that's still not...\n\nMy point is, why do they love [party_baron.GetHerHim] so much?!"

 party_baron.3002.desc:0 "So it is not enough that [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] is beloved by all, #EMP I#! must love [party_baron.GetHerHim] as well?\n\nSeveral of my vassals have signed a writ requesting that I cease speaking foul words about that useless [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitleAsName')]!"

But of course instead [party_baron.GetSheHe] continues without flinching. "Could we talk for a moment?"\n\nEverything that happens next is a blur, but it turned into one of the best feasts of my life. I must admit, perhaps I was wrong about the [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitleAsName')] after all..."
 party_baron.3003.a:0 "To think you would get me in the end, [party_baron.Custom('CTPFirstNameNoTooltip')]!"

 party_baron.3004.desc:0 "This has gone on long enough! The fact that [party_baron.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] keeps being elevated as some beacon of everything good in humanity is driving me mad!\n\nWhatever manipulative spell [party_baron.GetSheHe] has the realm under needs to be broken."
