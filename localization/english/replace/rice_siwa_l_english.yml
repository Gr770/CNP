 siwa.0010.t:0 "Fountain of the Sun"
 siwa.0010.desc:0 "I have made arrangements to visit the Fountain of the Sun in Siwa. Even in ancient times, Herodotus praised its seemingly legendary ability to heal visitors.\n\nThe local elders are more than happy welcome me into town, as it is a great honor for them. However, one question remains. Should I come there privately, or should this be a public affair? If I do the former, the townspeople will agree not come to the area while I am there. If I do the latter, I will get to mingle with the locals."
 siwa.0010.a:0 "I prefer to visit the springs privately in peace."
 siwa.0010.a.tooltip:0 "You will relax more and lose more [stress|E], but will have less opportunities to improve relations with the locals."
 siwa.0010.b:0 "I don't mind sharing the springs with others."

 siwa.0011.desc.public:0 "At last, the day has come, and we arrive at the Fountain of the Sun in Siwa. Though my bodyguards keep the locals at arm's length, the townspeople seem eager to see me here. I talk with some of the local notables about issues affecting their community, while we soak ourselves in the waters in the hopes its healing properties will rejuvenate our health.\n\nThe day goes by quickly, and soon it is time for us to go. We leave the springs in great spirits, our worries and stresses no more, at least for now."
 siwa.0011.desc.private:0 "At last, the day has come, and I arrive at the Fountain of the Sun in Siwa. I spend a couple hours relaxing there, soaking myself in the waters and hoping they will rejuvenate my health.\n\nThe day goes by quickly, and soon it is time for me to go. I leave the springs refreshed and feeling like a new person."
 siwa.0011.a:0 "I hope to be back soon!"
 siwa.0020.t:0 "The Temple of Hibis"
 siwa.0020.desc:0 "I have arrived at the great Temple of Hibis in Kharga. In ancient times, it was the largest temple in the Western Desert, and now it has been restored to its former glory. Back then, the people of the oases worshipped several gods. With the revival of these old forms of worship, the priests can ask the deities for a blessing. \n\nI greet the priests outside, and am ushered inside the temple so that the ceremony can begin. If my visit proves fruitful, who knows what good fortune might befall us?"
 siwa.0020.a:0 "The splendor of the Temple of Hibis is truly unmatched."
 siwa.0021.t:0 "Who To Pray To?"
 siwa.0021.desc:0 "Now that the ceremony is about to begin, I need to decide which of the local deities I wish to seek out for aid.\n\nI could approach the major gods of this region, such as Amun or Seth. Or, I could seek the help of tutelary gods of the Western Desert, such as Ha or Igai."

 siwa.0022.desc:0 "The priests take me to a special chamber, which has a statue of Amun resting against the wall. Though it is not that tall, and only a little larger than the average man in size, its face is serene and stern in a way that exudes majesty.\n\nThe oracular priest beckons me to stay in the back, before asking me to write what questions I want to ask Amun on a piece of papyrus. After writing it down, I give it to the oracular priest, who steps in front of the statue and performs a brief ceremony, which involves a number of prayers and incantations. The priest leans over, as if to listen to the statue speak or make some noise.\n\nI stand where I am, eagerly waiting to hear what the oracle has to say on the matter I asked about, which had to do with…."

 siwa.0024.t:0 "The Oracle of Siwa"
 siwa.0024.desc:0 "I have arrived at the great Temple of Amun in Siwa to seek advice from its famed oracle, just like Alexander the Great did in antiquity. Of course, I will be expected to give an extra offering to the temple and the gods, but that is a fair price to pay to listen to such divinely inspired guidance.\n\nAnyways, once I greet the priests outside, and am ushered inside the temple so I can greet the Oracle."
 siwa.0024.a:0 "To think that the ancient Oracle of Amun is alive once more!"
 siwa.0050.desc:0 "Throughout Egypt, and much of the Mediterranean world, vast monuments of stone litter the landscape, remnants of antiquity’s great empires. Kharga Oasis, in particular, is home to a number of such ruins, given it has been the largest oasis town in the Western Desert for centuries.\n\nToday, while traveling through the area around Kharga, I came across a series of neatly laid stones, which the locals say are the remnants of an old aqueduct built by the Romans. It is sadly in a state of disrepair, and has been for centuries."
 siwa.0050.a:0 "One can only imagine what it was like back in the day!"
 siwa.0050.b:0 "Perhaps our engineers can find a way to rebuild even a small part of it. "
 siwa.0051.t:0 "The Water Well"
 siwa.0051.desc:0 "In the western deserts of Egypt, water wells are a rare and precious commodity. A well-to-do local notable wishes to sell one of the wells he owns in this region, and is offering a decent price for it."
 siwa.0051.a:0 "It’s a deal! The well belongs to me now."
 siwa.0051.b:0 "I am not interested in this kind of deal."
 siwa.0051.c:0 "For that price? I think you can do better."
 siwa.0052.t:0 "Date Farming"
 siwa.0052.desc:0 "For centuries, date farming has been important to the livelihood of people in the Western Oases. The date farms in my territory in this region are currently producing a lot more dates than normal, boosting the local economy."
 siwa.0052.a:0 "Great to hear!"
 siwa.0053.t:0 "Date Farming"
 siwa.0053.desc:0 "For centuries, date farming has been important to the livelihood of people in the Western Oases. The date farms in my territory in this region are currently producing less dates than normal, which will have repercussions on the local economy."
 siwa.0053.a:0 "That’s not good."
 siwa.0054.t:0 "Zerzura, the Lost City"
 siwa.0054.desc:0 "A few weeks ago, a caravan of traders got lost in the western deserts and were presumed dead. Today, a survivor from that caravan miraculously managed to make his way back to territory under my control.\n\nHe claims the caravan got lost in a sandstorm, but he alone was rescued by tall, fair-skinned men and women wielding strange swords and spears. They took him to their city, Zerzura, the fabled lost city of Egypt’s western desert, which was built with pearly white stones and possessed all manner of luxury.\n\nAfterwards, he made his way back home."
 siwa.0054.a:0 "We hear of stories of Zerzura every now and then, so his tale seems believable."
 siwa.0054.b:0 "I have my doubts - perhaps he was hallucinating due to dehydration in the desert."
 siwa.0055.t:0 "Mountain of the Dead"
 siwa.0055.desc:0 "Not too far from Siwa Oasis is the so-called Gebel al-Mawta, or the Mountain of the Dead. This conical shaped mountain is said to have been the central necropolis of the ancient Siwans, back when the Pharaohs and Romans ruled this land, for it contains many man-made caves that are often discovered to house mummies and other burial goods.\n\nLately, a number of Siwan families, attracted by the large open spaces of the caves, have started moving in to make their homes. Other locals fear this is a bad idea and think occupying the mountain should be forbidden, lest the spirits of the dead be disturbed."
 siwa.0055.a:0 "Let the locals decide among themselves - it’s not my concern."
 siwa.0055.b:0 "Those people can move in. Why fear those who are already dead?"
 siwa.0055.c:0 "Those are justified concerns. Forbid anyone from moving in."
 siwa.0056.t:0 "Hermits of Kharga"
 siwa.0056.desc:0 "For centuries, Kharga Oasis has been a refuge for Christian hermits, whether to escape the temptations of ordinary life or flee religious persecution. They often live in the rugged hills and caves some distance from Kharga, and spend most of the day praying and engaging in other religious practices.\n\nWhether Christian or not, Kharga’s rulers have tolerated these hermits, as many pilgrims often come to visit them, which is good for business. Recently, one of the hermits’ representatives has approached me, explaining they are short on supplies, and humbly request a small donation."
 siwa.0056.desc.christian:0 "As a fellow Christian, he says I can show how magnanimous and devout I am, so both parties would benefit."
 siwa.0056.desc.nonchristian:0 "Though I am not Christian, he says I can show how magnanimous and tolerant I am, so both parties would benefit."
 siwa.0056.a:0 "Yes, very well - you shall have the aid you seek."
 siwa.0056.b:0 "I am sorry, I cannot afford to spare anything."
 siwa.0056.c:0 "Insolence! Banish these greedy heathens to the desert!"
 siwa.0057.t:0 "Infidel Rock"
 siwa.0057.desc:0 "Near Farafra Oasis is a large formation of several rocks. As I pass through it today, I have to concede it is a towering and majestic sight. The people who live here have called it “Infidel Rock” for many generations, and according to local lore, it is the place where the famed army of the Persian King Cambyses went before they departed on their ill-fated journey to Siwa Oasis - a journey in which none of the men returned."
 siwa.0057.a:0 "Interesting."
 siwa.0058.t:0 "Hagar al-Makhrum"
 siwa.0058.desc:0 "I had to go out into the desert near Farafra Oasis on a trip today. Coming back, I passed by a sizeable, natural stone arch at a top of a ridge. Its local name is Hagar al-Makhrum, or the Rock with a Hole."
 siwa.0058.a:0 "A majestic sight."
 siwa.0059.t:0 "Olives"
 siwa.0059.desc:0 "Olive farms are a common sight in the oases in the western desert of Egypt. While not as lucrative as olives farmed in other regions of the Mediterranean, they nevertheless bring in quite some profit. I have the opportunity to invest in some olive farms at the moment in the oases that I control. Perhaps it would be a good idea for an investment?"
 siwa.0059.a:0 "Indeed. Let’s make the necessary arrangements."
 siwa.0059.b:0 "No, I don’t think we need to do that."
 siwa.0060.t:0 "Karshef"
 siwa.0060.desc:0 "I am visiting a powerful, local elder in Siwa Oasis to discuss important matters related to the administration of the oasis. While outside it is very hot today, the moment I step inside his house, it suddenly feels so cool, as if a gentle breeze were blowing through. This can be attributed to karshef, the mixture of mud and minerals traditionally used to make houses in Siwa since ancient times, that keeps the house cool and comfortable in hot weather."
 siwa.0060.a:0 "Dear elder, it is good to see you! Now onto business…."
 siwa.0061.t:0 "Kellis"
 siwa.0061.desc:0 "While traveling through Dakhla Oasis, I pass by some abandoned ruins. My guide tells me that this was once the town known as ‘Kellis’ in Roman times, and a major site of pagan worship. Now, nothing remains but dust and stone, with some of the buildings mostly or partly buried by the sand. The locals avoid inhabiting the ruins, out of fear that they may collapse, as happens on occasion."
 siwa.0061.a:0 "A reminder of those who came before us."
 siwa.0062.t:0 "Pasha Hindi"
 siwa.0062.desc:0 "Many people in Dakhla Oasis, especially those who live in the village of Bashendi, often like to claim that they are descended from a certain Indian prince, known as Pasha Hindi (hence the name of village). It is said that after being exiled from his homeland in India, he traveled far and eventually settled in Dakhla, where he became a respected local leader. At a meeting today with several notables from the area, one of them claimed to be one of the senior descendants of this Pasha Hindi, though others have disputed his claim in the past. Regardless, he’s pretty proud of it and boasts about it frequently during the meeting."
 siwa.0062.a:0 "If he is descended from Pasha Hindi, he is right to be proud."
 siwa.0062.b:0 "These vain claims hard to substantiate - anyone can say such things!"
 siwa.0062.c:0 "What arrogance! He must show humility in front of me, his liege."
 siwa.0063.t:0 "Olives and Dates"
 siwa.0063.desc:0 "Some locals from my territories in the Western Desert have approached me with an offering of tribute of prized olives and dates from their village."
 siwa.0063.a:0 "Your gift is much appreciated."
