 claim_throne_ongoing.1001.desc:0 "I clearly do not stand alone in my ambition to rule [target_title.GetNameNoTooltip]! Ravens have been gathering on the roofs of [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstNamePossessive')] [target.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], and a few nights ago even the stars seemed to be falling, all over [target_title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nPeasants and nobles alike whisper that it is a sign that [target.Custom('CTPFirstNameNoTooltip')] has lost the favor of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm]."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1001.a:0 "It is time for a new [target.Custom('CTPTitleAsNameNoTooltip')]!"

 claim_throne_ongoing.1002.desc:1 "My pursuit of the [target_title.GetName] is not driven by a mere lust for power, but because I am the only one who can bear the enormous responsibility! Even [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] seems to acknowledge this, as [target.GetSheHe] grants me increasingly important tasks in service of the realm.\n\nSoon I might as well be ruling the [target_title.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip] in all but name..."
 
 claim_throne_ongoing.1003.desc:0 "I am quite aware that if I were to serve as [target.Custom('CTPTitleAsName')] of [target_title.GetNameNoTier], I require the support of my now-fellow vassals more than [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] currently has.\n\nIllustrating how generous I would be as [target.Custom('CTPTitleAsName')] could go a long way."
 
 claim_throne_ongoing.1006.desc:0 "As with so many other things, my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('friend'))], [friend.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')], sees eye to eye with me on the matter that [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] is not fit to rule [target_title.GetNameNoTier].\n\n"I can think of far better candidates," [friend.GetSheHe] lets me know in confidence. "And you stand first among them. Give the word, and you have my support.""
 
 claim_throne_ongoing.1007.desc:2 "Word of my ambition to take control of [target_title.GetNameNoTier] has started to spread among the [GetPlayer.Custom( 'KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase' )] of the realm. Discontent rises within the rank and file as many believe it is time for a change.\n\nAs this tension seethes, I am approached by none other than [scheming_knight.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')], one of [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstNamePossessive')] [GetPlayer.Custom( 'KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase' )]. "Our warriors deserve better than this. Promise fair treatment to our men, as well as a generous purse of gold, and you will have my sword.""
 
 claim_throne_ongoing.1008.desc:1 "My efforts to bolster my claim on [target_title.GetName] could perhaps be aided by some trickery.\n\nA letter proclaiming that the end is nigh has been circulating through neighboring realms as of late. With a bit of forgery and patience, I'm sure I could craft a similar letter proclaiming that I should rule instead of [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')].\n\nBut how should I use such a letter?"
 
 claim_throne_ongoing.1009.desc:0 "It seems like [fraud_catcher.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] is trying to make a name for [fraud_catcher.GetHerselfHimself] by claiming my recent letter is a mere forgery and that none of the claims within are true.\n\nAnd even worse, [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')] is believing every word of it! Have I been found out?"
