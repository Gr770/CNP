 befriend_ongoing_rival.0004.desc:0 "I desperately tried to explain my opinion in a way which would make sense from [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstNamePossessive')] point of view, but I only ended up entangling myself in my own arguments. \n\nThis gave [target.GetHerHim] plenty of angles to attack me from, and I came out of the argument looking like a damned fool."

I had [spymaster.GetHerHim] investigate its source, and to no great surprise, it seems like the guilty culprit was none other than [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')]. \n\n[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], why won't that lying [target.Custom('InsultNoun')] stop this nonsense?!"

 befriend_ongoing_rival.2000.desc:0 "I always seem to be focusing on [target.Custom('CTPTitledFirstNamePossessive')] negative sides which is rather unproductive with my current goal in mind.
