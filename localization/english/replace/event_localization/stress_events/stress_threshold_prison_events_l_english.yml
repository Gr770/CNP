 stress_threshold_prison.1031.desc:0 "Locked up here, I am supposed to be weak and pacified. Hah!\n\nHere in the darkness I gather my strength and tear my enemies limb from limb with my mind! Over and over again, every day they are reborn and every day I destroy them like the vermin they are! Especially my wretched jailer, [jailer.Custom('CTPTitledFirstName')]... [jailer.GetSheHe] will suffer the most!"
