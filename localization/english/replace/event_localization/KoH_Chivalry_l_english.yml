 chivalry.2.d: "As I walk down the streets of my capital, I hear a voice. "You there!" a man yells, drawing his sword. \n\n"What do you want?" I respond quickly, hand on my hilt. \n\n"You are [ROOT.Char.GetNameNicknamed]. An exceptional warrior, so they say, and I am here to fight you for glory!" \n\nWe size each other up at a glance."
 
 chivalry.3.d: "As we both draw our weapons, I realize a weakness in my opponent's defense. Before I have time to react though, [challenger.Custom('CTPRegName')] charges in, catching me off-guard. I find myself on the defensive, unable to deal any blows to my opponent. What shall I do?"
 
 chivalry.4.d: "The fight continues. Both of us exchange blow after blow, hoping to defeat one another. Suddenly, I see an opening. As I slash into it, [challenger.Custom('CTPRegName')] takes a step back and yells "I yield!" He draws a ragged breath. "It seems I have been bested by you.""

The duel has developed into a fight for my survival. The clash of steel, and the ferocity of [challenger.Custom('CTPRegName')] keeps me from going into the offensive. Suddenly, he slashes into me, knocking me on the ground."
