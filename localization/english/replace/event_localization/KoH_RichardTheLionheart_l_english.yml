Bones are fractured, teeth cracked, eyes blinded by darkness, and death’s direful spectre ever lurks in the shadows cast by these bold, resplendent knights. \n\nToday, the sovereign sport of princes has claimed another life; this time, one whose loss will have consequences far beyond the tourney field.
